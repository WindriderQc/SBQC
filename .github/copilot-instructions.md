## Authentication Architecture (IMPORTANT - READ FIRST)

**See `AUTHENTICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` for complete details.**

### Core Principles
1. **DataAPI is the single source of truth** for all authentication
2. **Session-based auth** (NOT token-based) - both SBQC and DataAPI share the same MongoDB session store
3. **Public-first approach** - most pages are public with bonuses when logged in
4. **User data lives in DataAPI** - SBQC never stores user credentials

### Session Flow
```
User ‚Üí SBQC ‚Üí Session Cookie ‚Üí DataAPI validates ‚Üí User attached to res.locals.user
```

### Page Access Strategy
- **Public pages** (/, /iot, /earth): Accessible to all, enhanced features when logged in
- **Protected pages** (/tools, /device/:id): Require login, redirect to DataAPI login if needed
- **API endpoints**: Some require auth, some are public with empty data fallback

### Key Auth Patterns
```javascript
// Attach user to all requests (in sbqc_serv.js, applied globally)
app.use(attachUser);  // from utils/auth.js

// Protect a route
router.get('/tools', requireAuth, (req, res) => { ... });

// Optional auth (public page with bonuses)
router.get('/iot', optionalAuth, (req, res) => {
  if (res.locals.user) {
    // Show enhanced features
  } else {
    // Show public version
  }
});
```

### Migration Status
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 Complete**: Session configuration aligned with DataAPI
  - Updated `sbqc_serv.js` with matching session config (database, name, secret)
  - Created `utils/auth.js` with attachUser, requireAuth, optionalAuth, requireAdmin middleware
  - Documentation: `.env.example` and `docs/AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md`
- üîÑ **Phase 2 In Progress**: Apply middleware and test session sharing
  - Need to apply `attachUser` globally in `sbqc_serv.js`
  - Test login flow: DataAPI ‚Üí SBQC
  - Remove `req.session.userToken` pattern from routes
- ‚è≥ **Phase 3 Pending**: DataAPI endpoint updates and final migration

### Environment Variables for Auth
```bash
# Must match DataAPI exactly
SESS_SECRET=<same-as-dataapi>
SESS_NAME=<same-as-dataapi>
MONGO_SESSION_URI=<same-as-dataapi>
```

## Quick context

This is a Node.js Express application (entry point `sbqc_serv.js`) that acts as a small IoT/web dashboard server. It integrates with:

- MongoDB (via `scripts/database.js`) ‚Äî collections are loaded into `app.locals.collections` and used across routes.
- MQTT (via `scripts/mqttServer.js`) ‚Äî `mqtt.initMqtt(url, handler, channels)` is called from `sbqc_serv.js`; device logic lives in `scripts/esp32.js`.
- External Data API (configured by `DATA_API_URL`) ‚Äî accessed through `services/dataApiService.js` and `services/apiClient.js`.
- Socket.IO (`scripts/socket.js`) ‚Äî used to emit real-time events to clients (e.g. ISS data relayed from MQTT).

Key run commands (from `package.json`):

- Start production: `node sbqc_serv.js`
- Start development with auto-reload: `npm run dev` (uses `nodemon`)

Environment variables: See `README.md` for the common ones, but the code requires at least the variables validated in `utils/envValidator.js`:

- MONGO_CLOUD
- DATA_API_URL
- SESS_NAME
- SESS_SECRET
- TOKEN_SECRET

Other envs referenced in code: `PORT`, `NODE_ENV`, `USER`, `PASS`, `MQTT_SERVER_WS`, `DATA_API_PORT`, `WEATHER_API_KEY`, `ALERT_EMAIL`.

## What an AI coding agent should know first

1. Single entrypoint and lifecycle:
   - `sbqc_serv.js` boots the Express app, initializes MQTT + esp32 handler, connects to MongoDB, loads collections into `app.locals.collections`, sets up routes, and starts the HTTP server.
   - Many modules depend on `app.locals.collections` being populated. Modifying collection access should preserve this expectation.

2. Data flow patterns:
   - External Data API is the authoritative source for registered devices, profiles and heartbeats. Calls go through `services/dataApiService.js` which caches device lists for 5 minutes.
   - MQTT messages are handled by `scripts/esp32.js`. It receives MQTT topics (e.g. `esp32/register`, `esp32/data/<id>`) and then calls `dataApiService` to persist or fetch config.
   - Socket.IO (`scripts/socket.js`) is used as a relay (e.g. `esp32.msgHandler` publishes `sbqc/iss` to `io.sockets.emit('iss', data)`). Avoid breaking this chain when changing MQTT or socket logic.

3. Error handling and conventions:
   - Routes and services use async/await and propagate errors to a centralized Express error handler defined in `sbqc_serv.js`. Use `next(err)` in routes.
   - Custom error classes live in `utils/errors.js`. Use `BadRequest` when request validation fails so the global error handler maps codes correctly.

4. Session & auth conventions:
   - **Authentication**: Uses nodeTools auth middleware (from `github:windriderqc/nodeTools`) for session-based authentication
   - **Session Sharing**: Sessions are stored in MongoDB via `connect-mongodb-session` and shared with DataAPI (session name: 'data-api.sid')
   - **Middleware**: `auth.attachUser` runs globally to populate `res.locals.user` from session
   - **Protected Routes**: Use `auth.requireAuth` middleware for routes requiring login (e.g., `/settings`, `/api/deviceLatest/:esp`)
   - **Optional Auth**: Use `auth.optionalAuth` for public routes with enhanced features when logged in (e.g., `/api/devices/latest-batch`)
   - **User Access**: In route handlers, check `res.locals.user` (populated by middleware) instead of manually checking session tokens
   - **Login Flow**: Users must log in through DataAPI (or local `/login`). Session cookies are automatically sent with requests - no manual token management needed
   - When adding new protected endpoints, apply `auth.requireAuth` middleware instead of manual session checks

## Project-specific patterns and examples

- Accessing DB collections: code expects `app.locals.collections.<name>` (e.g. `req.app.locals.collections.userLogs`). When adding new code that needs DB access, accept `req` and use `req.app.locals.collections` rather than creating a new DB client.

- External API fetch wrapper: use `services/apiClient.js` with `fetchJSON(url, options)` to ensure consistent error handling and logging.

- MQTT usage:
  - Initialize only once via `scripts/mqttServer.initMqtt(url, handler, channels)` ‚Äî `mqttServer.getClient()` asserts initialization.
  - Topic handlers in `scripts/esp32.js` should return `true` when a message was handled, otherwise `mqttServer.consoleMsg` is used as a fallback.

- Code that relies on caching or background tasks:
  - `scripts/syncRepos.js` is invoked on startup with `setImmediate()` and runs in background ‚Äî don't block startup with long-running synchronous tasks.
  - `services/dataApiService.getRegisteredDevices` uses an in-memory cache ‚Äî if tests need a fresh list, call with `forceRefresh = true`.

## Developer workflows (what to run & where to look when debugging)

- Start locally:
  - Set required env vars (see `README.md` and `utils/envValidator.js`).
  - `npm install` to install dependencies.
  - `npm run dev` to run with auto-restart.

- Debugging DB issues:
  - Look at `scripts/database.js` ‚Äî collections are enumerated on connect and saved into `app.locals.collections`.
  - If a collection is missing, the code often defensively creates a reference (see `isses` handling). Prefer to add similar defensive checks.

- Debugging MQTT / IoT flows:
  - Check `scripts/mqttServer.js` for connection and subscription logic.
  - Inspect `scripts/esp32.js` for message handling and relays to the Data API.
  - For integration tests, stub `mqttServer.getClient()` or mock `mqtt.connect`.

## Tests and linting

- The repository includes `mocha` and `chai` in `devDependencies` and a `test` script in `package.json` (`npm test`). There are no visible unit tests in the repo root; if adding tests, prefer targeting services (`services/`) and utils (`utils/`) which are pure functions.

## Small actionable rules for code suggestions

1. Preserve startup sequence: maintain DB connect -> loadCollections -> routes order. Avoid moving DB-dependent code before collections load.
2. Prefer `fetchJSON` from `services/apiClient.js` for external calls. If you must use `node-fetch` directly, handle non-OK responses as `fetchJSON` does.
3. Use `req.app.locals.collections` for DB access. If a route needs a collection that may not exist at startup, add a defensive fallback like `app.locals.collections.isses = db.collection('isses')` does.
4. Respect session-based auth: check `req.session.userToken` where applicable and reuse `hasSessionID` middleware pattern if adding protected pages.
5. For MQTT/topic changes, adjust `scripts/mqttServer.js` subscription list in `sbqc_serv.js` and update `scripts/esp32.js` handlers. Keep handlers idempotent and return `true` when they fully handle a message.

## Files to open first when working on a change (priority)

1. `sbqc_serv.js` ‚Äî app bootstrap and integration wiring
2. `scripts/database.js` ‚Äî DB connection and `app.locals.collections` behavior
3. `services/dataApiService.js` + `services/apiClient.js` ‚Äî external API contract and caching
4. `scripts/mqttServer.js` + `scripts/esp32.js` ‚Äî MQTT wiring and device message logic
5. `routes/*.js` ‚Äî routing and usage of sessions and collections

## If anything here is unclear

Please point to the file and the behavior you want changed. I can update these instructions to include more examples (e.g., common request/response shapes) or expand debugging recipes (sample cURL commands, sample MQTT messages) if you want.
